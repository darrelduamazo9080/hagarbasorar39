                If you don&#039;t want to add anything to your shower curtain, consider purchasing a heavy shower liner that will go over the curtain and hold it in place against the tub as you shower. A few times it immediately started sliding i would double check that your shower curtain is extended as much as possible while still fitting in place. Consider how that shower curtain will get attached to the shower curtain rod.

    <h3>It will stay up for sure if there is no weight on it.</h3>
    <p>Here&#039;s how often and exactly how to get that shower curtain and liner squeaky clean at home. Place your phrase on your curtain and decide how you want to align things. You can even make your own shower curtain lining out of clear vinyl for those irregular sizes. I used 1 3/8 alligator clips from radio shack, 3/4 oz bass weights from wal mart (as much as i can&#039;t stand the place i knew i&#039;d seen them there), and the plasti dip was available at.</p>
